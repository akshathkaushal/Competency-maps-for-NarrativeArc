Competency Map organises a learning space in terms of basic units of learning, each of which is called a competency. The competency map is organised as a 2-dimensional progression space. A progression space not only has a concept of distance between any pairs of competencies, but also a partial ordering that indicates progress made by a learner on reaching some competency. In addition to the idea of progression, a competency map needs to be organised such that, learning resources mapped onto the space can create coherent sequences of learning pathways that can be traversed on the space.
